                        Inflation is the process by which a currency like the dollar or Euro loses value over time, causing the price of goods to rise. Bitcoin (and some other cryptocurrencies) are designed to experience predictable and low rates of inflation.

                        One attribute that has made cryptocurrencies — particularly Bitcoin — so appealing to investors is the idea that they’re more resistant to inflation than fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But what is inflation? Inflation is the process by which currencies lose value over time, causing prices of consumer goods to increase. Because most economists believe that some level of inflation is good for the economy, the U.S. government, for instance, has printed more money than consumers actually need for decades. It’s the reason that a Coke that cost a nickel a half-century ago goes for a few dollars today.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Bitcoin, on the other hand, has generally increased in value much faster than the U.S. dollar has lost value — going from virtually worthless in 2010 to more than $20,000 in late 2020. (Because it’s a volatile market, Bitcoin has also seen dramatic spikes and declines, but the trendline over time has been upward.) This has made Bitcoin an increasingly popular hedge against fiat-currency inflation.

                    <p>
                        The main way Bitcoin is designed to resist inflation is that its supply is limited and known, and the creation of new bitcoin will taper off over time in a predictable way. (There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin, and every four years the amount of bitcoin that is mined is reduced by half.)

                    <p>A high inflation rate for fiat currencies might lead individuals to invest more in digital money because the dollars or Euros they placed in a savings account are actually losing value over time. Bitcoin and certain other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum offer investors an alternative. The economics of the Bitcoin market are complex, but there are some features designed into the digital currency that may help it to resist inflation.</p>

                        Yes, technically even Bitcoin experiences inflation as more of it is mined (as does gold). But because the amount of new bitcoin is automatically reduced by 50 percent every four years, Bitcoin’s inflation rate will also decrease.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a practical matter, as long as Bitcoin’s purchasing power continues to rise vs. the  fiat currencies we tend to compare it to, Bitcoin’s few-percent annual rate of inflation isn’t a major factor for investors to consider.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But not all cryptocurrencies are designed like Bitcoin. For instance, an increasingly popular category of digital money called stablecoins — many of which are pegged to fiat currencies like the dollar — can be a useful, low-volatility place to save some money. But if a stablecoin is pegged to a fiat currency, your investment will be impacted by inflation and could lose value over time as their reserve currency loses value. (Some stablecoins offer rewards that function much like an interest-bearing savings account, which could change the value equation — especially with non-crypto interest rates hovering around zero.).

                        When people talk about measuring volatility, they’re usually referring to “historical volatility,” a number derived from a study of prices over a specific time period (often 30 days or a year). The prediction of future movements is called “implied volatility” — and because nobody can actually predict the future it’s a less exact science (although it’s the basis for widely used financial tools like the Cboe Volatility Index, nicknamed the “fear index,” which predicts the next 30 days’ stock market volatility).   Quantifying volatility can be done a couple of ways:

                        Volatility is one of the primary factors that goes into assessing investment risk. Traditionally, investors will take on a high level of risk if they believe the potential reward is worth the possibility of losing some of their investment. (Or all of their investment, as in the recent case of high-risk hedge-fund manager Bill Hwang, whose entire $20 billion dollar fund disappeared in two days.)

One popular strategy is to invest in a basket of stocks (or an index fund), rather than just a few. To further reduce the potential for downside, they may also pair investments in more volatile asset classes like stocks with investments in less volatile classes like bonds."

That said, higher trading volumes on Bitcoin (by far the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap) and increased institutional participation seem to be reducing its volatility over time. Cryptocurrencies with lower trading volumes or emerging cryptoassets like DeFi tokens tend to have higher volatility — when experimenting with these assets as a beginner it’s best to risk amounts you can afford to lose."

                        For some crypto investors, high volatility is part of the appeal — it creates the possibility for high returns. (And even as Bitcoin’s volatility seems to be declining, it often moves by double-digit percentages in a single week, allowing for strategies like “buying the dip.”)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For less risk-tolerant investors, there are strategies that can be used to limit the downside impact of volatility, like dollar-cost averaging. (Generally, investors with longer-term strategies who have good reason to believe that an investment will ultimately rise over time don’t need to think as much about short-term volatility.)  And there are now cryptocurrencies specifically designed to have low volatility called stablecoins (including USD Coin and Dai) — these have their price pegged to a reserve asset like the U.S. dollar.
