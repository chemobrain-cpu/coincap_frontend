                    5. HOW YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS USED
                </h2>


                <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a secure, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We generally use personal information to create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our Services, content and advertising; and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes. We may use this information in the following ways:
                </p>

                <p className={styles.paragraph}>(1) To maintain legal and regulatory compliance</p>

                <p className={styles.paragraph}>Most of our core Services are subject to laws and regulations requiring us to collect, use, and store your personal information in certain ways. For example, CB must identify and verify customers using our Services in order to comply with anti-money laundering laws across jurisdictions. This includes collection and storage of your photo identification. In addition, we use third parties to verify your identity by comparing the personal information you provide against third-party databases and public records. When you seek to link a bank account to your CB Account, we may require you to provide additional information which we may use in collaboration with service providers acting on our behalf to verify your identity or address, and/or to manage risk as required under applicable law. If you do not provide personal information required by law, we will have to close your account.</p>

                <p className={styles.paragraph}>(2) To enforce our terms in our user agreement and other agreements</p>

                <p className={styles.paragraph}>

                    CB handles sensitive information, such as your identification and financial data, so it is very important for us and our customers that we actively monitor, investigate, prevent, and mitigate any potentially prohibited or illegal activities, enforce our agreements with third parties, and/or prevent and detect violations of our posted user agreement or agreements for other Services. In addition, we may need to collect fees based on your use of our Services. We collect information about your account usage and closely monitor your interactions with our Services. We may use any of your personal information collected for these purposes. The consequences of not processing your personal information for such purposes is the termination of your account.
                </p>

                <p className={styles.paragraph}>(3) To detect and prevent fraud and/or funds loss</p>
                <p className={styles.paragraph}>We process your personal information in order to help detect, prevent, and mitigate fraud and abuse of our services and to protect you against account compromise or funds loss.</p>

                <p className={styles.paragraph}>(4) To provide coincap's Services</p>

                <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    We process your personal information to provide the Services to you. For example, when you want to store funds on our platform, we require certain information such as your identification, contact information, and payment information. We cannot provide you with Services without such information. Third parties such as identity verification services may also access and/or collect your personal information when providing identity verification and/or fraud prevention services.

If you establish a CB Account indirectly on a third party website or via a third party application, any information that you enter on that website or application (and not directly on a CB website) will be shared with the owner of the third party website or application and your information will be subject to their privacy policies.

                    9. HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION
                </h2>

                <p className={styles.paragraph}>

                    We understand how important your privacy is, which is why CB maintains (and contractually requires third parties it shares your information with to maintain) appropriate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of the personal information you entrust to us.

                </p>
                <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    We may store and process all or part of your personal and transactional information, including certain payment information, such as your encrypted bank account and/or routing numbers, in the US and elsewhere in the world where our facilities or our service providers are located. We protect your personal information by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.

                </p>
                <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    For example, we use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. Full credit card data is securely transferred and hosted off-site by payment vendors like Worldpay, (UK) Limited, Worldpay Limited, or Worldpay AP Limited (collectively “Worldpay”) in compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). This information is not accessible to CB or coincap staff.

                </p>

                <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    However, we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, unauthorized acquisition, or alteration of your data will not occur. Please recognize that you play a vital role in protecting your own personal information. When registering with our Services, it is important to choose a password of sufficient length and complexity, to not reveal this password to any third-parties, and to immediately notify us if you become aware of any unauthorized access to or use of your account.

                </p>

                <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    Furthermore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or confidentiality of information you transmit to us or receive from us by Internet or wireless connection, including email, phone, or SMS, since we have no way of protecting that information once it leaves and until it reaches us. If you have reason to believe that your data is no longer secure, please contact us using the contact information provided in the “How to contact us” section below.

                <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    We rely primarily on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses to facilitate the international and onward transfer of personal information collected in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom and Switzerland (collectively “European Personal Information”), to the extent the recipients of the European Personal Information are located in a country that the EU considers to not provide an adequate level of data protection. This includes transfers from our EU-based CB operating entities to our US-based operating entity, coincap, Inc. We may also rely on an adequacy decision of the European Commission confirming an adequate level of data protection in the jurisdiction of the party receiving the information, or derogations in specific situations.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    coincap, Inc. is responsible for the processing of personal information it receives and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Before we share your information with any third party, coincap, Inc. will enter into a written agreement that the third party provides at least the same level of protection for the personal information as required under applicable data protection laws.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    coincap, Inc., also participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. Under the Privacy Shield Framework, coincap, Inc. is subject to the authority of the Federal Trade Commission.
